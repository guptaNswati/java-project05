FEEDBACK:

Nice clean implementation of your LazySearchTree class with lazy deletion!


-0 For future, include all RUN files in resources folder.


-1 Missing documentation for your classes, etc in Javadocs.
	I see that you commented your source code for FoothillTunesStore.
	Why are you excluding documentation for key methods of LazySearchTree class?
	 
	Perhaps you forgot to generate Javadocs as required by project?
    See feedback from previous project.
    
    Next time minus two for this.


Extra Credit:
+2 Good testing of lazy removal in FoothillTuneStore.

+2 Good testing of findMin() and findMax() in class FoothillTuneStore.


-Bita.
